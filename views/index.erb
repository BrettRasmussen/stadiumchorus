<h2>Come sing in the Stadium of Fire!</h2>

<p>2010 marks the 30th anniversary of the Stadium of Fire, and we are excited to
have returning members as well as new recruits for the choir.</p>

<p>This page contains all important information and will be updated as new
information comes in, so please read it completely and check back
periodically.</p>


<h2>Choir Size</h2>
<p>We need between 300 and 350 voices.  If you know of other singers, please
send them to this page.</p>


<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>You must be of high-school age or older.</li>

  <li>You must be able to hold your own voice part while others are singing
  different parts in the other sections (don't worry&mdash;the sections will not
  be intermingled with each other).</li>

  <li>You must be able to attend all rehearsals (exceptions granted on a
  case-by-case basis).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Rehearsal / Performance Schedule</h2>
<p>The first four rehearsals are for choir only, and will be at these times:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tuesday, June 15, 7pm-9pm <font color="red">CANCELED</font></li>
  <li>Saturday, June 19, 10am-12pm</li>
  <li>Tuesday, June 22, 7pm-9pm</li>
  <li>Saturday, June 26, 10am-12pm</li>
</ul>

<p>The schedule for the week of the performance is not yet set, but will likely
be close to the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Thursday, July 1, evening: Blocking at stadium</li>
  <li>Friday, July 2, afternoon: Choir rehearsal at stadium</li>
  <li>Friday, July 2, evening: Full Stadium of Fire dress rehearsal</li>
  <li>Saturday, July 3, from about 5pm on: Stadium of Fire</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>REHEARSAL LOCATION:</strong>  The first four rehearsals will probably
be held at a chapel near BYU.  You will be notified via email, and it will be
posted here.</p>


<h2>Recording</h2>
<p>We will be looking for a small group of advanced singers (around 40
voices) from among the choir members who can participate in a prior
recording session of the music we will sing on the 4th.  This will require
an audition, which will be announced at the first or second rehearsal, as
well as the recording date.  It will also require participants to know their
music exceptionally well.</p>


<h2>Tickets</h2>
<p>Each member of the choir will get in for free.  No complimentary tickets will
be available for loved ones, but the Stadium producers will set aside a few
hundred tickets for purchase by members of the choir for their loved ones during
a specified block of time (probably about a week long) a few weeks before the
performance.  We also recommend you try to join the choir as couples or
families, provided all can meet the requirements.  Note that we may or may not
be able to sit with loved ones in the audience when we are not singing.</p>


<h2>Music</h2>
<p>Music has not been decided yet, but you will be given instructions once it
is.  You will most likely need to come to this website, download it, print it,
and bring it to rehearsal.</p>


<h2>Fireworks</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, you probably won't be able to see the fireworks because you'll
be on stage singing at that time.  The producers might allow us a few numbers
during the pyro medley wherein we can turn around and watch, but there's no
guarantee.  We will be able to see Carrie Underwood and much of the rest of the
program.</p>


<h2>Signing Up</h2>
<p>The "Sign Up" link to the right will take you to the sign-up page.</p>


<h2>Contact</h2>
<p>You may email us at stadium<foo>choir<foo>@<foo>twoedge<foo>.<foo>com
with any questions you may have.  Please be patient, as there aren't very
many of us.  We'll try and get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
